# Project Vision

Flora is a task manager with very simple interface to manage your tasks

The end goal is to have an intuitive, selfhostable and privacy respecting app to manage tasks.
The app will be divided into two parts, client and a server. The client doesn't need a server to function because it can use a local storage to save all the data. In most cases this should be enough and since the app is a Progressive Web App, you don't even need to download anything. It will work fine offline. If you want to access the same tasks list on multiple devices, you can just install the server on a VPS for example and then point the client to it. The client will then sync your tasks to the server. Now you can use the Flora App on any device, Android, IOS, or Desktop to connect to the same server and always have your tasks synced across multiple devices.
